# 365id Scanner SDK Terms

## 365id SDK Terms (the "Terms"):

1. The 365id Scanner Software Development Kit ("365id SDK") has been developed by 365id AB ("365id", "we" and "us").
2. The 365id SDK is to be accessed, downloaded and/or used only by corporate or natural persons that are authorised to do so (each an "Authorised User") under a separate written agreement with 365id (an "365id Contract"). If you are not an Authorised User, you are not permitted to – and you agree that you shall not – access, download, distribute, copy or otherwise use or exploit the 365id SDK or any part of it or its documentation.
3. The 365id SDK comprises elements that are 365id copyright, as well as elements that are licensed by third parties under certain open source software licenses (each an "OSS Agreement"), which may be found below (or in their respective package). Anyone accessing or downloading the 365id SDK is deemed to agree to the OSS Agreements and these Terms.
4. Authorised Users should consult their 365id Contract as to how they are permitted to use the 365id SDK. No usage by Authorised Users is allowed except as provided in the relevant 365id Contract.
5. Any rights Authorized Users may have to use the 365id SDK are subject to the OSS Agreements.
6. The 365id SDK is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and noninfringement. In no event shall 365id be liable for any claim, damages or other liability, whether in contract, tort or otherwise, arising from, out of or in connection with the 365id  SDK or any use of or other dealings with the 365id SDK.
7. Without limiting the above provisions of these Terms, you agree that you will not and will not allow a third party to:
   1. attempt to defeat, circumvent or disable any copy protection mechanism in the 365id SDK;
   2. reverse engineer, disassemble or decompile 365id SDK software or apply any other process or procedure to derive the human readable form of any software included in the 365id SDK (except to the extent that any reduction of such software to human readable form is necessary for the purposes of integrating the operation of that software with other software or systems used by an Authorised User, if 365id has not provided the information necessary to achieve such integration within a reasonable period of the Authorised User requesting it);
   3. access all or any part of the 365id SDK in order to build or facilitate the build of a product or service which has functions or features similar to or competes with the 365id SDK or any of our products or services;
   4. remove, obscure or alter any intellectual property right or confidentiality notices or legends appearing in or on any aspect of any of the 365id SDK;
   5. pass off the 365id SDK as being a work of any person or entity other than 365id and the licensors under OSS Agreements; or
   6. modify, distribute, alter, or tamper with the 365id SDK or any of its documentation, or otherwise do anything restricted by 365id’s copyright and other rights in the SDK and its documentation.
8. We reserve the right to take all steps available to us in enforcing our rights, whether under these Terms, our intellectual property rights or otherwise.
